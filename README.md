I had the opportunity to attend the University of Minnesota Cybersecurity Boot Camp where I learned hands-on training in Networking, Systems like Linux and Windows, Web, Databases (ELK Stack), as well as Defensive and Offensive Cybersecurity practices. 

I have also completed the CompTIA Security + Certification and have learned many Cyber Security Industry Standard practices to include the following: Packet Analysis, Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities, Cryptography, Architecture and Design, Implementation, Operations and Incident Response, and last, Governance, Risk, and Compliance
