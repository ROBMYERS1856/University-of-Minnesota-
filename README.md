I had the opportunity to attend the University of Minnesota Cybersecurity Boot Camp where I learned hands-on training in Networking, Systems like Linux and Windows, Web, Databases, as well as defensive and offensive cybersecurity practices. 

I have also completed the CompTIA Security + Certification and have learned many Cyber Security Industry Standard practices to include the following: Packet Analysis, Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities, Cryptography, Architecture and Design, Implementation, Operations and Incident Response, and last, Governance, Risk, and Compliance 
 
## Networking:

    - Packet Analysis
        - Splunk
        - Wireshark
        - Kibana
        - Security Onion
        - Nessus
        - SNORT 
    - Azure Virtual Machines

## Systems:

    - Windows and Linux Administration Techniques
    - Windows and Linux Hardening

## Cybersecurity:

    - Secure Network Design and Architecture
    - Risk Management
    - Cryptography
    - Vulnerability Assessment
        - Red and Blue Teams 
    - Identity and Access Management
    - Cloud Security
        - AWS, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
    - Ethical Hacking and Penetration:
    - Digital Forensics 
        - Autopsy and Cell Phone Forensics 
    - Web Vulnerabilities and Security

## Cybersecurity Careers:

    - Digital Forensics Methods
    - Penetration Testing
    - Vulnerability Assessment
    - Security Operations and Analytics

## Programming and Scripting:

    - Bash Scripting
    - PowerShell Scripting
    - HTML/CSS/Java
    
## What you can expect upon graduating:

By the time you complete the program, you will know how to:
Conduct vulnerability assessments using tools like Metasploit to profile an application for vulnerabilities, and then exploit those vulnerabilities

Configure machines on a virtual network, deploy them to the cloud, and investigate cloud security risks

Identify suspicious patterns of user behavior to identify bots, intruders, and other malicious actors

Write Bash scripts to automate security and operating systems tasks

Last, you should be prepared to successfully complete the **<u>CompTIA Security +</u>** Certification
