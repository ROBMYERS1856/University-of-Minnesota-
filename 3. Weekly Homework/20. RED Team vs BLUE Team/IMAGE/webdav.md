## Connect to the Summit Card Union Web Server via WebDAV

* The goal is to connect to the server (192.168.1.105) via WebDEV and establish a reverse shell 
* NOTE: Remember that you will be prompted to enter a User Name and Password.
* NOTE: Remember that we used CrackStation to get Ryans password (linux4u).
