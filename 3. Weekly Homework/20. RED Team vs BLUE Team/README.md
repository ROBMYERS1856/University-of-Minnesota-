## Rob Myers Week 20 Project 2: RED TEAM vs BLUE TEAM---

### Overview:

We have covered a lot of security domains in the last several weeks. From hands-on practice attacking machines during pentesting units to monitoring and protecting against breaches during our SIEMs units, we are ready to apply our knowledge to many real-life scenarios. 

### RED TEAM vs BLUE TEAM Project:

For this project, you will work on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which you will play the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.

As the Red Team, you will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. 

As Blue Team, you will use Kibana to review logs taken during the RED TEAM Attack. Last, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.

### RED TEAM Pen Test

For this scenerio I will be using my KALI LINUX Virtual Machine to attack the following CAPSTONE Virtual Machine.

* KALLI LINUX VM:
    
    - IP Address: 192.168.1.90

* CAPSTONE VM:

    - IP Adress: 192.168.1.105
