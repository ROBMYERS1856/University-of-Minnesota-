## Rob Myers Week 20 Project 2: RED TEAM vs BLUE TEAM

### Overview:

We have covered a lot of Cyber Security Fundamentals up to this point. We have experience attacking machines as well as monitoring and protecting against breaches during our SIEMs units. Now, we are ready to apply our knowledge to many real-life scenarios. 

### RED TEAM vs BLUE TEAM Project:

For this project, you will work on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which you will play the role of both <u>**Pentester** and **SOC analyst**</u>.

As the <u>**RED TEAM**</u>, you will attack a vulnerable VM within your Azure Virtual Machine environment, and gain root access to the machine. 


As <u>**BLUE TEAM**</u>, you will use Kibana to review logs taken during the RED TEAM Attack. Last, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.

### RED TEAM Pen Test

For this scenario I will be using my AZURE KALI LINUX Virtual Machine to attack the following CAPSTONE Virtual Machine.

* KALLI LINUX VM:
    
    - IP Address: 192.168.1.90

* CAPSTONE VM:

    - IP Address: 192.168.1.105
