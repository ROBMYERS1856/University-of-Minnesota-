### Searching for the file: secretfile.txt

* Picture shows my process of elimination
* I did find two commands that located the secretfile.txt and also a secretfile.txt.lnk
* however I believe the correct answer for this question specifically would be: search -f *secretfile*.txt since it is only asking for the secretfile.txt file specifically
