 # Rob Myers: FINAL PROJECT

This is my Final Project for The University of Minnesota Cyber Security Boot Camp. For this Final Project I will be demonstrating ALL of the skills I have learned throughout the course.

For this Final Project I will be demonstrating THREE critical area's of knowledge:

* BLUE TEAM Operations: Security Analysis
* RED TEAM Operations: Pen Testing
* NETWORK FORENSIC ANALYSIS: Investigating and applying both RED and BLUE Team Skills

### Please review the following Reports I have completed for my Final Project.

### Each of these reports contain critical information demonstrating the knowledge I have learned from the University of Minnesota Cyber Security Boot Camp.

## BLUE TEAM OPERATIONS:

* Network Topology: **Creating Network Diagram**

* Description of Targets: **Azure VM (Hyer-V), Kali Linux, ELK Server, Capstone and a Target Machine to perform Pen Test** 

* Monitoring the Targets: **Creating Alerts using KIBANA**

* Patterns of Traffic & Behavior: **Reviewing pcap files using WIRESHARK** 

* Mitigation Strategies: **Understanding how to defend and safe guard the network**

## RED TEAM OPERATIONS:

* Exposed Services: **Using NMAP to identify points of entry**

* Critical Vulnerabilities: **Knowing how to Enumerate websites, MySQL Database Access, Open Ports, vulnerable software, and remote access (SSH/Shell)**

* Exploitation: **Perform Pen Test applying the skills learned (SSH, wpscan, nmap, MySQL exploits, cracking pass words using John The Ripper/HYDRA and other common Pen Testing techniques)**
