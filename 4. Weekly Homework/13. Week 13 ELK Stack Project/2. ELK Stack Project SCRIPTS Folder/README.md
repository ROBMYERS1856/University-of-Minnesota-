# ELK Stack Project Scripts

Inside the ELK Stack Projects SCRIPTS Folder you will find all of the scripts used to complete the ELK Stack Project (Ansible,DVWA,Filebeat,and Metricbeat).

There is also an ELK Stack Diagrams folder that will show you the AZURE diagrams for the virtual network we created. 

You will also find the Linux File that contains Week 3 Terminal and Bash and Week 5 Archiving and Logging Bash. These homework assignments demonstrate knowledge learned while attending the University of Minnesota Cyber Security Boot Camp regarding Linux Terminal/Command Line and Bash Scripts. 

In these lessons we learned popular Linux commans like Pipe and Grep as well as other commands. It also introduced us to creating scripts using Bash. 

Please feel free to explore these files.
